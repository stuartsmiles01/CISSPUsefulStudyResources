6) Sunflower Notes                - https://www.sunflower-cissp.com/downloads/sunflower_cissp_layout.pdf  (Recommended by Thor Pedersen)               
                                  - Read notes as a reference - lots of content / refresher

7) Rest and Sleep                 - Don't kill yourself on reading everything as content base is enormous, and it would put you off ever taking the exam.                        

8) Practice questions in CISSP book, Chapter Summaries

Personal Advice 

- review ALL the main book bits, especially chapter summary sections and do the practice tests in the book. highlight as you go, so if flick reading afterwards you know what you thought was important previously. 

- everything is easier with others at the same time - see if you can get a gang together to do it at the same time and support / go through the process together, provide reinforcement

A) Once you've decided to do it, and feel somewhat familiar with the main content book the exam. I went for a month in advance and set the date/time. 
B) Go for somewhere you know where it is so there's no challenge in getting to the test centre/parking etc 
C) When you pass, you need to do "endorsement" - you need to upload paperwork for previous roles that would reflect the "security work" you have been doing and show a job history
D) Good Luck  - but you won't need it, 
E) Say thankyou to the people around you that you have lost weekends and evenings for whilst doing study
E) Keep studying and preparing for the next one, it never ends. 

Final Thoughts: 

Decide to enjoy the exam experience - it is there to show that you can rather than you can't. 
It's a 3 hour exam but goes by in a flash. 
No sweets are allowed in the test centre - get 
No going back to previous questions in the exam 


Good luck & Best wishes for the exam. 

Thanks
Stuart
