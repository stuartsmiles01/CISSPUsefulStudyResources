3) Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP   - https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/9574376478  "The Effective CISSP: Security and Risk Management" website - https://wentzwu.com/  
4) Wentz Wu does Practice questions daily on his facebook group, had a look on his website, don't seem to have bought it though.   

5) Luke Ahmed                     - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197 "How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam" 
                                  - I bought Kindle version of the book
                                  - Sold as a way to think sensibly for exam questions  

6) Sunflower Notes                - https://www.sunflower-cissp.com/downloads/sunflower_cissp_layout.pdf  (Recommended by Thor Pedersen)               
                                  - Read notes as a reference - lots of content / refresher

7) Practice Tests book            - Looked through the practice tests book, bought as a bundle with the CISSP Official study guide, did practice questions.  

8) Rest and Sleep                 - Don't kill yourself on reading everything as the content base is enormous, it would put you off ever taking the exam.                        

9) Practice questions in CISSP book, Chapter Summaries, Use highlighters, Set a date.

Personal Advice 
---------------

- review ALL the main book bits, especially chapter summary sections and do the practice tests in the book. highlight as you go, so if flick reading afterwards you know what you thought was important previously. 

- everything is easier with others at the same time - see if you can get a gang together to do it at the same time and support / go through the process together, provide reinforcement

A) Once you've decided to do it, and feel somewhat familiar with the main content, book the exam. I went for a month in advance and set the date/time. 
B) Go for somewhere you know where it is so there's no challenge in getting to the test centre/parking etc 
C) When you pass, you need to do "endorsement" - you need to upload paperwork for previous roles that would reflect the "security work" you have been doing and show a job history
D) Good Luck  - but you won't need it, 
E) Say thankyou to the people around you that you have lost weekends and evenings for whilst doing study
E) Keep studying and preparing for the next one, it never ends. 

Final Thoughts: 
---------------

Decide to enjoy the exam experience - it is there to show that you can rather than you can't. 
It's a 3 hour exam but goes by in a flash. 
No sweets are allowed in the test centre - get some breakfast first and a drink of water so you're good for the duration.  
No going back to previous questions in the exam, select the best answer and move on 
Watch Thor's video about timings per question.  

Good luck & Best wishes for the exam.
